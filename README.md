# [Aurora Water Project](https://github.com/ryanallison/Aurora-Water-Project.git)
- This was for job interview. 
- This was my first Data Analyst interview after leaving teaching.
- We were given about 2 or 3 days to complete.
- It's not perfect but I think I did a descent job for my skill set at the time.
- I have come a long ways from then but wanted to showcase this project.
